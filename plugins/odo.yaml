      Show an access matrix for server resources
      This plugin retrieves the full list of server resources, checks access for
      the current user with the given verbs, and prints the result as a matrix.
      This complements the usual "kubectl auth can-i" command, which works for
      a single resource and a single verb. For example:
       $ kubectl access-matrix
      It also supports a mode which prints all subjects with access to a given
      resource (needs read access to Roles and ClusterRoles). For example:
       $ kubectl access-matrix for configmap
